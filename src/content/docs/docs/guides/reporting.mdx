To generate a report, first go to the records and reports screen. Begin by going to the Clients screen.

Tap on the Client whose data you want to generate the report on.

Then tap on the session you want to generate the report on. Once you tap on it, it will be selected. You can then tap on the View Data button in the bottom left corner. This will bring you to the records and reports screen.

After that, tap the Generate Report button in the bottom left corner. This will bring up the Select Report Sections pop-up, allowing you to choose which sections you want in your report.

There are many sections available, generally separated into three major categories.

- The report header contains information on the client
- The clinical summary provides a high-level overview of the report's content
- The detailed report contains all the data associated with the report.

At the bottom of this pop-up, you will see three buttons:

- One to reset the selected sections
- One to generate a full report (including all sections)
- One to generate a report with only the selected sections.

By tapping on either "Full Report" or "Selected Sections," the report will be generated, and you will be brought to the report screen showing the generated report once it is completed.

The majority of the report screen displays the generator report itself. Across the top, we see a navigation bar with a back button on the left and a few other buttons on the right.

Up here, we have a button to show the table of contents, which mirrors the section selection pop-up.

Tapping on any section will scroll the report in the main body of the page to make the appropriate section visible. Next to that is the share button, which uses Apple's built-in share functionality to let you export the report. In particular, this is how you would save the report to a PDF document.

The last button on the nav bar opens a drawer on the right side of the screen with several text fields.

These text fields correspond to the various types of notes you can take to accompany this report. The contents of these text boxes will be mirrored in their corresponding sections of the actual body of the report so that they will still be there when exported.
