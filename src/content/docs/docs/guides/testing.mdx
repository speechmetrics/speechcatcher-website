</Steps>

## Running the Test

When you tap **Start Test**, a confirmation screen appears showing:

- The test name (and language/dialect if applicable)
- A **Begin** button in the center
- A back button (top-left) to return without starting

Press **Begin** to display the first test image.

Each image contains one or more **targets**:

- **No targets:** Tapping does nothing.
- **One target:** The whole image is the target. Tapping records the word.
- **Multiple targets:** Tap the specific area to record that target.

Interaction types:

- **Short press:** Marks the target as produced incorrectly.
- **Long press:** Marks the target as produced correctly.

At the bottom of the screen:

- **Center button:** Shows the target prompt (press again to cycle through prompts).
- **Left/right arrows:** Navigate between images.

In the top-left corner, a **Pause** button lets you temporarily stop the test.  
When paused, you'll see:

- Test name (and dialect if applicable)
- Number of targets recorded so far (e.g., `15/20`)
- Options to **Resume**, **Cancel**, or **Finish**

- **Resume:** Returns to testing after a short confirmation screen.
- **Cancel:** Ends the session without saving.
- **Finish:** Saves the recording and test data.

After canceling or finishing, you can choose to navigate to:

- Home screen
- Client screen for the tested client
- Records & reports screen
- Transcription screen for the first recorded record

**Image of the pause message**

At the end of a test, you'll see a completion screen showing:

- Number of targets recorded (e.g., `20/20`)
- If some targets were missed, an option to return and record them

**Image of the finish message**

If **Automatically advance test screens** is enabled in settings, the app moves to the next image once all targets on the current screen are recorded.  
This is **enabled by default**.

Once testing is complete, you can move on to **transcribing your recorded data**.
