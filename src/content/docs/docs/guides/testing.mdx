## Running the Test

When you press "Start Test" the first thing you see is a message indicating you're about to begin the test. It shows the name of the test in the specified language and dialect, if applicable. There is a big button in the middle that says "Begin." In the top left corner, you'll see a back button in case you decide not to start.

After pressing "Begin," you will be presented with the first image of the test.

**Image of the a test screen**

These images contain what are called targets; an image can have zero, one, or multiple targets. Images with no targets will not record anything when you tap on them. If there is one target, that target comprises the entire image, and tapping on it will record the word associated with it. If an image contains multiple targets, you tap on the corresponding area of the image to record that target. With any given target, there are two main ways of interacting with it. You can either do a short press or a long press. A short press indicates an incorrect production of the target, while a long press indicates an incorrect production.

Across the bottom of the screen you will see a row of three buttons. The one in the middle shows a prompt for the given target (iterating through the prompts if there's already a prompt showing when you press it). On either side of that, there are arrow buttons for navigating between images.

In the top left corner you will see a button to pause the test. If you pause the test, a message will say that you have now stopped your recording, followed by the name of the test, showing the dialect if applicable. It will show you how many targets you have recorded as a fraction, and you'll have options to either resume testing, cancel testing, or finish testing. Resuming will bring you back to testing after a resume message, which is similar to the beginning message. Cancel will conclude the test without saving the recording or any associated data. Finish will conclude the recording and save the recorded data. If you finish or cancel, you'll be presented with options on where you want to navigate to next in the app. These options include the home screen, the client screen for the client being tested, the records and reports screen, which shows all the recorded records, and the transcription screen for transcribing the first recorded record.

**Image of the pause message**

When you reach the end of a test, you'll see a message indicating that you've reached the end. It will show the number of targets you've recorded as a fraction of all the targets in the test. If you have recorded all of them, the test will automatically finish. If not, there will be an option to go back and record the remaining targets. Pressing this will return you to the test and let you record the targets that have not been recorded.

**Image of the finish message**

There is an option in the app settings to automatically advance test screens. If enabled, whenever you have recorded all the targets on a screen, it will automatically go to the next image. This option is enabled by default.

Once you're done testing, it's time to transcribe your recorded data.
