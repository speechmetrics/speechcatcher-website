Once you've recorded speech test data in SpeechCatcher, the next step is to transcribe it phonetically. This guide walks you through the transcription process.

SpeechCatcher is in active development, so the interface may change.

## Accessing the Recorded Data

1. From the **Clients** screen, select the client you just tested.

## The Transcription Screen

At the top, you'll see:

- **Left/right arrow buttons** to navigate between records
- The **record number** you're currently editing
- The **image** associated with the record

To the right, you'll find four key text fields:

- **Orthography** — The word's spelling in its language
- **Model** — The expected phonetic (IPA) representation
- **Actual** — The client's produced form
- **Notes** — Any additional comments

### Side Panel Buttons

- **Book icon:** Shows alternate word forms with their orthography and IPA, based on language, dialect, or synonyms (e.g., “cat” and “kitty” in English).
- **Data tiers button:** Displays extra reference data (e.g., translations) if provided by the test creator. Disabled if none are available.
- **Three-dot button:** Reserved for future functionality.

## Working with the Audio Waveform

Below the text fields is the **waveform view**:

- The highlighted segment corresponds to the moment the target was tapped during testing.
- Drag the **handles** to adjust the segment's start/end.
- Tap the segment to play it.
- Use the **loop toggle** to repeat playback.

Additional features:

- **Zoom controls** (bottom-left)
- **Center view button** to re-focus on the segment
- **Playback speed control**
- **Play button** for segment-only playback

The secondary, zoomed-out waveform below acts as a navigation preview.

## Phone Alignment View

The **phone alignment view** displays both the **Model** and **Actual** phonetic representations, helping clinicians analyze speech production.

### Editing Phones

- Tap a phone to open the **IPA keyboard**.

The keyboard includes four layouts:

1. Consonants
2. Vowels
3. Diacritics
4. Suggestions (context-specific, based on defined phonetic processes)

- Selecting a phone and pressing a key **replaces** the symbol.
- Using the small **dots beside each phone** lets you **insert** symbols without replacing existing ones.

### Syllable Bars

Below both transcripts are **syllable bars**:

- Tap a bar to see suggestions specific to that syllable.
- For tonal languages (e.g., Mandarin), you can also add or adjust tones.

## Validating a Record

To the right of the phone alignment view is a **large checkmark button**:

- Pressing it **validates** the record, marking it as reviewed and ready for inclusion in reports.

If **Automatically advance records** is enabled in Settings, the app moves to the next unvalidated record after validation.  
This option is **enabled by default**.

Once all records are transcribed and validated, you're ready to **generate a report**.
